A Todo Web App 

This project is a test phrase for me to enter into Bene Studio.

**Features:**

1. It has to be a React.js Todo Web app
2. List items
3. Add item
4. Edit item
5. Remove item
6. Mark as done
7. Mark as undone


It is using Material-UI(see http://www.material-ui.com/#/) as a theme framework.
